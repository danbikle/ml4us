How to install R?

sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev

Which installs R under /usr/lib/R/ rather than under /home/
which is different than how we install:
  - Python
  - Ruby
  - Java
  - Node.js
We install the above four languages under /home/
because it allows us flexibilty when we encounter language related problems.
