This file contains info about my interactions with Google Hangout (GH).

GH is a video calling app which competes with Skype.

To learn GH follow this link:

Another way to learn GH is to get two laptops and login to gmail on each laptop.

You should login to different gmail accounts on each laptop.

Then, hold a GH session between the two laptops.

Finally, try various experiments.

If you have only one laptop, try running GH on the laptop connected to GH on your phone.

Also you can run GH on your laptop connected to GH running on a fake linux laptop inside VirtualBox.



Some features of GH are listed below:

* GH works best inside a chrome-browser
* I can send a GH-link to a friend who can click that link to start the call
* Or, if I see a friend in gmail, I click the video-camera next to their name to start a call
* When that happens, my friend should see a call-request on the left-side of gmail
* Once connected, we can see each other if video cameras are turned on
* Once connected, we can hear each other if microphones are turned on
* Often we will turn-off the video cameras and rely only on microphones
* If I have 5 friends, I can send a GH-link to them so all 5 of us can have a call
* When connected to 5 people, it is polite to mute your microphone, unless you want to talk
* Another way to communicate on GH is to use text-chat
* Text-chat is very important in GH
* Use text-chat to communicate when your microphone malfunctions (which is a frequent bug)
* You can disable the view of text-chat, but that is impolite
* It is polite to enable the view of text-chat
* GH allows a teacher to share screen with students
