This script should download prices and predict daily direction of GSPC.
It should generate a label which I assume to be dependent on price calculations.
A label should classify an observation as down or up. Down is 0.0, up is 1.0.
It should generate independent features from slopes of moving averages of prices.
It should create a Logistic Regression model from many years of features.
Demo:
spark-shell -i logr12c.scala
