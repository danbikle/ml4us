Registration Link: 
https://register.asapconnected.com/CourseDetail.aspx?CourseId=109653&ext=1

This class is unique due to its dual nature.

We focus on both Machine Learning technology AND Application Development.

The type of ML-applications we develop are web-applications and REST API servers.

The Web frameworks we study are Ruby on Rails, Flask, and Flask-RESTful.

The Machine Learning technology we study mostly focuses on preparing and feeding observations of training data to the API layers of popular ML-frameworks: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Keras-js, Spark MLlib, R-glm, and Postgres-MADlib.

Often we rely on ML-frameworks to build predictive models and then generate either predictions or forecasts from newer data.

For the ML APIs we use these languages: Python, JavaScript, Scala, and SQL.

Next we rely on the Web-technology to help the end-user consume and visualize predictions or forecasts.

The class meets ten times on Saturdays 10am to 2pm.

The winter session starts on Dec 9 and ends Feb 17.

The cost is $439.

Location: Bldg-F, Room F4, Santa Clara Adult Ed. 1840 Benton St. 95050
Which is near Scott Blvd. and El Camino
