The steps listed below are used to describe class KerasService.get() method.

- Get tkr from end-user
- Get yr2predict, yrs2train, feature names from end-user
- Get CSV data from yahoo
- Copy Date and Close into a DF
- Sort the DF by Date
- Rename Close to Price
- Generate dependent variable:
  - pctlead (for regression predictions)
  - updown (for classification predictions)
- Generate price based features:
  - pctlagX
  - slopeX
- Generate date based features:
  - dow (Day of Week: 1,2,3,4,5)
  - moy (Month of Year: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12)
  - Scale them by dividing by 100
- Copy the features into feat_df
- Use yr2predict to copy one year of test data from feat_df into test_yr_df
- Use yr2predict, yrs2train to copy many years of training data from feat_df into train_df
- Create a model from Keras
- Fit the model to train_df
- Predict observations in test_yr_df
- Calculate Accuracy of predictions of test_yr_df
- Calculate Effectiveness of predictions of test_yr_df
- Save predictions to DB
- Report results to end-user
