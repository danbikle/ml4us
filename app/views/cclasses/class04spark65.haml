%h2 Class04 Answer:
%h2 Copy logr12.scala to linr11.scala. Enhance it to use Linear Regression.

%p This lab required some knowledge.

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class04spark66'

%p I saw something like this:
.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class04spark67'

%p For 2016 test data, I translate the above report into English:
%ul
  %li The Effectiveness of a Long-Only model is 12.34%

  %li The Effectiveness of Negative Linear Regression predictions  is 2.97%

  %li The Effectiveness of Positive Linear Regression predictions  is 15.31%%

  %li So, for 2016, Linear Regression beats Long-Only.

  %li The accuracy data is listed below:

  %li Total 2016 observation count: 100+35+85+32 is 252

  %li True Positive Count: 100
  %li True Negative Count: 35

  %li False Positive Count: 85
  %li False Negative Count: 32

  %li Accuracy is (100+35) / 252.0 is 53.6%
  %li So, for 2016, Linear Regression beats Logistic Regression.
