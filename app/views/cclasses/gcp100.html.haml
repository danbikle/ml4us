%p This class should teach you how to interact with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) at a very simple level.

%p GCP is extremely feature rich which means it might confuse you with its complexity.

%p This class should show you some basics which you can use right away.

%p To get started in my GCP kitchen, I located two important ingredients:

%ul
  %li My Credit Card
  %li My gmail address

I logged into gmail.

Next, I visited the URL listed below:

https://cloud.google.com/

Then this:

https://cloud.google.com/docs/

Then this:

https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/frequently-asked-questions

I registered; I gave GCP my Credit Card info; GCP gave me a $300 credit.

Not everyone gets a $300 credit; I'm not sure why.
