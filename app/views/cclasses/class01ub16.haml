%h2 Class01 Lab Answer:
%h2 Install ub16_2018_0206.ova inside VirtualBox on your laptop.

%p This is easy.

%p Download this file and then click on it:

%p
  %a(href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/10p1W7kqzxE69jODhUzcb-qi-osN4htO-' target='x')
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/10p1W7kqzxE69jODhUzcb-qi-osN4htO- [ub16_2018_0206.ova]
    
%p Be patient, maybe do this at home before class; this is a large file: 12GB

%p The password for the ann account is 'a'.

%p
  The Operating System in this virtualbox is Ubuntu 16.04 which should eventually be better
  than Ubuntu 14.04.

%p This virtualbox should contain recent versions of these languages:
%ul
  %li Python
  %li Ruby
  %li Java
  %li R
  %li Node.js

%p On my laptop I clicked on ub16_2018_0206.ova which brought up an import GUI.

%p The GUI is a little tricky but not that bad.

%p After I start the import it should finish in 10 or 20 minutes.

%p After import, I should click the green start button.

%p So, I did that.

%p After 3 minutes, it offered me a login screen.

%p At the password prompt for ann I typed in 'a'.

%p A minute later I saw the Ubuntu 16 desktop screen inside a VirtualBox window.

%p After I saw the desktop, I ran three shell commands:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code.bash
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt upgrade
      sudo shutdown -r now

%p The last command rebooted the new Ubuntu instance for me.

%p Sometimes the command:
.syntax
  %pre
    %code.bash
      sudo apt update
%p will fail because of an Ubuntu-locking bug.

%p The easiest way to work-around this Ubuntu-bug is to wait 10, 30, or 60 minutes.
%p Before you do that, however, try to connect your browser to google.com which will give the network-stack a little poke.

%p After the poke, try this command again:
.syntax
  %pre
    %code.bash
      sudo apt update

%p If that fails, wait 10, 30, or 60 minutes.

%p If that fails to fix the problem, then apt update and upgrade are broken on your VirtualBox.

%p If the VirtualBox instance is for training, I ignore the update-upgrade-problem.

%p If the broken VirtualBox instance is for production, I seek professional help.
