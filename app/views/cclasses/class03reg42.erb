This page should discuss the creation of a simple machine learning app.

The product idea behind the app is that it should
compare effectiveness of GSPC predictions computed from
Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.

How should I start?

I usually start by picking a Linux distribution.

During that decision I usually pick Ubuntu 16.04 which is supported by Canonical until April 2021.

I have established a convention that I should create a new linux account for each app that I create.

To follow that convention, I created an account named reg42 using the shell commands listed below:

sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G sudo reg42
sudo passwd reg42
