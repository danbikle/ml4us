This page should discuss the creation of a simple machine learning app.

The product idea behind the app is that it should
compare effectiveness of GSPC predictions computed from
Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.

How should I start?

I usually start by picking a Linux distribution.

During that decision I usually pick Ubuntu 16.04 which is supported by Canonical until April 2021.

Next, which account should own the software of the app?

I have established a convention that I should create a new linux account for each app that I create.

To follow that convention, I created an account named reg42 using the shell commands listed below:

sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G sudo reg42
sudo passwd reg42
ssh -AY reg42@localhost

Next, which languages will my app depend on?

Well, reg4.us should be a loosely coupled web app which relies on Python to generate Machine Learning predictions.
And, reg4.us will rely on Rails 5.2.x to serve the predictions to browsers.

On my laptop, after I created the reg42 account and logged into it, I issued these shell commands to install Python:

wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.3.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda3-5.3.1-Linux-x86_64.sh -b
mv ~/anaconda3/bin/curl ~/anaconda3/bin/curl_ana
echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc

Next I used these shell commands to install Ruby and Rails:

cd ~
curl -L ml4.herokuapp.com/.gemrc > .gemrc
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git      .rbenv
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git .rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"'                 >> ~/.bashrc
bash

rbenv install 2.5.3; rbenv global  2.5.3; gem install bundler
