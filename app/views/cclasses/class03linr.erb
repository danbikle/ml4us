I should show how to fit a line to two points.

The two points which interest me are the first trading day in 2016 and the most recent trading day in 2016.

mkdir -p ~/tmp/c3
cd       ~/tmp/c3

I should get prices from ml4.us:

curl -L ml4.us/csv/GSPC.csv > /tmp/GSPC.csv

echo 'cdate,cp'                                         > GSPC2.csv
grep -v Date /tmp/GSPC.csv|awk -F, '{print $1 "," $5}' >> GSPC2.csv

I should plot all prices from 2016.
