%h2 Class09 Answer:
%h2 Generate Models/Predictions from Features

%p When I started this lab I wanted to build Logistic Regression models for all available observations.
%p After experimentation, I found that this idea was not feasible; it takes too long.

%p So I wrote the script below which builds models for a random sample of observations:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class09s22a'

%p I ran the above script and it needed about 19 hours to run.

%p The resulting CSV files are listed below:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class09s22b'

%p In November of 2017 I ran the model building script again.

%p I collected predictions from a similar script into a tar file you can download:

%p
  %a(href='/class09predictions.tar.bz2') ml4.us/class09predictions.tar.bz2

%p
  %a(href='class09#op')
