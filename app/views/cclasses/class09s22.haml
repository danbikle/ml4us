%h2 Class09 Answer:
%h2 Generate Models/Predictions from Features

%p When I started this lab I wanted to build Logistic Regression models for all available observations.
%p After experimentation, I found that this idea was not feasible; it takes too long.

%p So I wrote the script below which builds models for a random sample of observations:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class09s22a'

%p In November 2017, I ran the above script and it needed many hours to run.

%p I collected predictions from a that script into a tar file you can download:

%p
  %a(href='/class09predictions.tar.bz2') learn4.us/class09predictions.tar.bz2

%p I wrote a script to report on the contents of the above tar file:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class09s22c'

%p I ran the above script and collected a screenshot:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'class09s22d'

%p I see that the most predictable combination of currency-pair and observation-training-count is AUDUSD and 107000 which gives an effectiveness sum of 8038.5 pips.
